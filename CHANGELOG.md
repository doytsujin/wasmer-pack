  commands can be accessed through one common object
  ([#34](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/34))
- Added a `wit-pack show` sub-command to show which libraries and commands would
  be generated from a Pirita file

## Fixed

- Inspect each atom's kind when discovering the commands in a Pirita file instead
  of blindly assuming everything is a command
  ([#32](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/issues/32))

## Fixed

- Inspect each atom's kind when discovering the commands in a Pirita file instead
  of blindly assuming everything is a command
  ([#31](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/issues/31))

# [0.2.3] - 2022-09-15

## Fixed

- When run as a WASI program, the `wit-pack` CLI would unconditionally fail
  to load inputs because `mmap` isn't available ([#24](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/24))

# [0.2.2] - 2022-09-15

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.2.1] - 2022-09-15

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.2.0] - 2022-09-15

## Added

- The `wit-pack` crate now allows packages to contain multiple WebAssembly
  modules ([#22](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/22))

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changed ðŸ’¥

- The `wit-pack` CLI now takes a Pirita file as its only input
  ([#20](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/20))
  - This means the commandline interface has changed
    ```console
    # Instead of this
    $ wit-pack js --exports exports.wit --name hello_world --version 0.1.1 --module wit.wasm -o=wit-js --abi=none

    # you should now do this
    $ wit-pack js -o=wit-js ./hello-world.webc
    ```

# [0.1.5] - 2022-09-12

## Added

- Introduced support for WASI libraries ([#12](https://github.com/wasmerio/wit-pack/pull/12))

## Changed

- The `crates/wit-pack-cli` and `crates/wit-pack-wasm` crates are now published
  to WAPM under the `wasmer` namespace instead of `Michael-F-Bryan`

# [0.1.4] - 2022-08-25

(no user-facing changes)

# [0.1.3] - 2022-08-25
