# Exposing Resources

## Intro

- A promise statement
  - We're going to introduce the concept of "resources"
  - Gives the host access to an "object" with associated behaviour without
    exposing how that object is implemented, or even which language it was
    written in
- A preview of what's to come
  - We'll turn our calculator into an object

## Body

Define the WIT file:

```rust
// calculator-v2.wit

resource calculator {
    static new: func(initial-value: f32) -> calculator
    current-value: func() -> f32
    add: func(value: f32)
    multiply: func(value: f32)
    divide: func(value: f32)
}
```

Implement the guest:
- Explain the need for interior mutability
- Publish

Use the bindings:
- Create a Python project
  - Use `pytest` to test the calculator is correct
- Create a JavaScript project
  - Similar tests, but with Jest

## Conclusion

- Reminder of how helpful the guide is
- Reiterate how important your topic is
- Call-to-action
  - Create a Regex library using the `regex` crate
